  "about": {
    "title": "About Cem",
    "content": "Hello, I am composer Cem Altun, based in Zurich, Switzerland. I was born in 1975 in Bursa as the son of a music and folklore teacher from Artvin. My childhood was shaped by a rich musical education filled with mandolin, flute, choir, piano, and bağlama lessons.\n\nAfter settling in Switzerland in 2007, my professional life advanced in the customs field. Having completed two different customs schools, I continue to work as a customs officer at the Zurich Briefzentrum. However, throughout this entire journey, I never disconnected from my true passion: music.\n\nI strengthened my academic foundation in narrative composition by completing the Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Composition for Film, Theatre, and Media at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK). within this scope, I have composed original scores for six theater plays, two documentaries, two promotional films, and one short film; additionally, I have participated as a composer in numerous advertising projects.\n\nWhile blending classical and neoclassical approaches in my work, I emphasize emotion, atmosphere, and dramatic structure through cinematic piano and orchestral arrangements. My goal is to create a musical world that deepens visual storytelling through sound, supporting the narrative like an invisible character.\n\nIf you enjoy discovering cinematic piano textures, orchestral colors, or highly expressive instrumental music, you are in the right place."
